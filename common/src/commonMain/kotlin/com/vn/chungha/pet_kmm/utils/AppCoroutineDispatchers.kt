   * ```

   *   /*
   *    * If it is known that updateUiElement can be invoked both from the Main thread and from other threads,
   *    * `immediate` dispatcher is used as a performance optimization to avoid unnecessary dispatch.
   *    *
   *    * In that case, when `updateUiElement` is invoked from the Main thread, `uiElement.text` will be
   *    * invoked immediately without any dispatching, otherwise, the `Dispatchers.Main` dispatch cycle will be triggered.
   *    */

   * Method may throw [UnsupportedOperationException] if immediate dispatching is not supported by current dispatcher,

   *
   * [Dispatchers.Main] supports immediate execution for Android, JavaFx and Swing platforms.
